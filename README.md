# Spike

A node based neural network. Nodes have a threshold for signaling children and a customizable function for processing incoming signals.

## Running

test-harness.py should manage to create a random network and trigger a small cascade. Mind that increasing the number of nodes in the network can greatly increase the processing power needed to run a cascade.

## TODO

Setup pygame visualiztion to verify cascade is functioning correctly.
